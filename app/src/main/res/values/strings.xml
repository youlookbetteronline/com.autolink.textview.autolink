        The story takes place in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077 universe.

        who can acquire skills in hacking and machinery with options for melee and ranged combat.
        The game was developed using the #REDengine 4 by a team of around 500 people,
        exceeding the number that worked on the studios previous game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015).
        CD Projekt launched a new division in @Wrocław, @Poland, and partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia,
        QLOC, and Jali Research to aid the production chatikyana@gmail.com. #Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith was a consultant,
        and actor Keanu Reeves has a starring role. The original score was led by Marcin Przybyłowicz,
        featuring the contributions of several licensed artists.
